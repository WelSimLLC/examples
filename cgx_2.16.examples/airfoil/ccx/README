Purpose:
This is a CalculiX-cfd example. The same model as for isaac 
will be read. But because ccx run's an inviscid calculation the mesh-density 
in the boundary-layer is reduced. In addition the model 
is sweeped from 2D to 3D. In the current state 
of ccx the achievable accuracy is only satisfying for inviscid calculations 
with an overall high mesh density. 

The results might be be compared to AGARD Report AR 138, May 1979

call cgx in the build mode:

  cgx -b send.fbl

call ccx with the prepared input file: (use only 1 thread since parallel
processing does not produce reliable results so far)

  export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1; ccx rae2822

Post-processing with:

  cgx rae2822.frd


Remark:
a restart is possible after writing velocity, temperature and pressure with:
send all abq lc<nr-of-dataset> (3 times, one for each dataset)
Then include the files in the initial conditions section and
start ccx again


PS
a second geometry file prepared for meshing with pentaeders is provided. The 
calculation speed is much faster but accuray is lower:
call cgx in the build mode:

  cgx -b send_penta.fbl
  export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4; ccx rae2822_penta
  cgx rae2822_penta.frd

REMARK: No valid solution could be achieved with the current version of ccx!
